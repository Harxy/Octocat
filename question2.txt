In Github, you can fork other people's repositories. This is great for either suggesting updates to their code or using the code in your own projects.

Upstream as a concept usually just means "projects in your repo's past" i.e the project before you made your changes (with downstream meaning just the opposite). Now, upstream can also specifically apply to the project you forked - the original origin. If you are planning on ever pushing your code to that original upstream (issuing a pull request to the original owner), then it is a good idea to keep your version updated from this "upstream" repo (because other changes may well continue being made).
